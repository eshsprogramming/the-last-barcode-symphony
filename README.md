Configuration
=============

You guys are going to hate me for this. There's quite a bit of setup required for the site.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Ruby
* Compass
* ZURB Foundation
* Jekyll
* Foreman

### Ruby

I recommend installing Ruby through [RVM](https://rvm.io/), but you're going to have a lot of fun doing that if you're on Windows. If you're on Windows you should probably just use the [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/).


### Gems

    $ bundle install

That was easy!


Generate and Serve the Site
---------------------------

    $ foreman start

You can now access the site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
